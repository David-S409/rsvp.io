- RSVPs submitted per month
- User retention rate
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- [ ] HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Prisma parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] Environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] GDPR compliance (data export, deletion)

---

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Architectural Decisions
- **Why Next.js?** Full-stack framework, great DX, easy deployment, SEO benefits
- **Why PostgreSQL?** Relational data fits our model, powerful queries, wide support
- **Why Prisma?** Type-safe, great migrations, excellent DX
- **Why NextAuth?** Industry standard, supports many providers, secure
- **Why Docker hybrid?** Consistent infrastructure, fast Next.js hot reload
- **Why Redis?** Fast session storage, caching for future features

### Open Questions
- Do we need real-time features? (WebSockets for live RSVP updates)
- Should we support multi-language from MVP?
- Payment gateway for future ticketing?
- Self-hosting vs managed services?
